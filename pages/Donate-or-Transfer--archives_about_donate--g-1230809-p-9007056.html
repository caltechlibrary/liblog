            The Caltech Archives and Special Collections welcomes donations of unique papers, photographs, film, video, digital files, and scientific apparatus created by Caltech faculty and other members of the Caltech community, as well as transfers of such materials from other departments on campus. We also systematically collect Caltech publications, and always appreciate anything that fills a gap in those collections.
           </p>
           <p>
            We carefully evaluate each prospective donation or transfer with regard to its utility for historical research. Professional and personal correspondence, laboratory and research notes, texts of lectures and other unpublished works, interviews, diaries, photographs, and scientific illustration are particularly well-utilized in our collections. Our collection development policy, below, describes what we collect in more detail.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also welcome monetary donations, which can support the preservation and digitization of our collections,

            The Caltech Archives and Special Collections collects records that provide unique documentation—beyond that already in the Caltech Archives or elsewhere—that can “facilitate understanding of Caltech’s role in the history of science and technology, and of the research and lives of its faculty, staff, and students.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Consistent with Caltech’s institutional commitment to diversity articulated in its
            <a href="https://deans.caltech.edu/HonorCode/statement-community">
             Statement of Community
            </a>
            , and to provide as complete a historical record as we can, the Caltech Archives prioritizes records that document identities and experiences that are not already well-represented in our collections, including those of people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ people.
           </p>
           <p>
            We prefer to collect records in the media in which they were intended to be experienced. We collect email in digital format rather than printed out, for example, and magazines in print rather than the computer files used to create them.
           </p>
           <p>
            With these principles in mind, we seek out and accept donations and transfers of the following records:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Papers and other unpublished records, including digital media, that document research, education, administration, and community life at Caltech. These include the professional and personal papers of Caltech faculty, as well as those of staff, alumni, and other affiliates who maintained long, close relationships with the institution. They also include records of administrative units, such as divisions and laboratories, that are responsible for research, communication, and community, and of student organizations. We have a particular mandate, documented in Caltech’s records retention schedule, to collect records of the Office of the President. Within these bounds, specific documents we collect include:
             <ol type="a">
              <li>
               Correspondence, including email, documenting research and all other aspects of the life of a collection’s creator. Correspondence is usually the portion of a collection which attracts the greatest research interest, and thus our highest collection priority. It documents not only the research and career of a collection’s creator, but also those of their colleagues, as well as relationships between people.
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
               Documentation of the process of research, including laboratory and field notebooks and other research notes.
              </li>

           <p>
            When considering possible donations of papers and other unpublished records, we also consider whether other archival collections associated with the same individual or institution are already housed in another archives. Because collections are most intellectually valuable and accessible to researchers when they are unified, we may suggest that donors continue to deposit in the same archives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since our focus is on science and technology at Caltech, in most cases we do not accept collections that primarily document the careers of Caltech alumni after graduation. We do assist donors, though, in finding appropriate repositories for such collections, including at the institution in which the alumnus in question worked or at other repositories such as:
