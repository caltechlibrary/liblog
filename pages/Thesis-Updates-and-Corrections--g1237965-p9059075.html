            Once your Committee and the Graduate Office have approved your thesis, that version is a matter of official record and will be archived as such. For this reason, you and your Committee must check the thesis thoroughly before submitting it.
           </li>
           <li>
            If your thesis has not yet been approved by the Graduate Office, you may still make revisions to your thesis document.  There are several ways of doing this.
            <ul>
             <li>
              Contact the library and ask for help
              <ul>
               <li>
                The library will either return the thesis submission to you for corrections and changes
               </li>
               <li>
                Or they will make the changes for you.  This can include having you send them new files (PDF and pre-PDF) of your thesis, or specific pages that we can replace for you.
               </li>
               <li>
                Send replacement files via the
                <a href="https://dropbox.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/dropbox.cgi">
                 Caltech DropBox

                during the week.  Please note that after 24 hours, Dropbox will delete your uploaded file, and the URL will become invalid.   Library staff may not get to it in time and will ask you to resubmit them.

              You may retrieve your thesis submission, make the changes in the original record, and resubmit it.
              <ul>
               <li>
                NOTE: this only works if your CaltechTHESIS record is still under Review and has not yet been released.
               </li>

             </li>
             <li>
              DO NOT create a "new version" of the original record.
              <ul>
               <li>
                The "new version" function creates a permanent link between the new and original records, and will show as a broken link if the original record is deleted.  If you have already deleted the original record, we will be forced to create a brand new one, starting from scratch.

           </li>
           <li>
            Any corrections to the thesis must be approved by your advisor and/or Committee and the Graduate Office. This especially applies to changes or additions of a greater magnitude than typographical errors.   The library will request written approval from at least one of them.
           </li>
           <li>
            Once the corrections have been approved, contact the library and ask to have the specific PDF pages replaced.  You may send them either a PDF copy of the corrected pages, or a PDF copy of the full thesis.  The library will make a permanent dark-archived copy of the original thesis, and then either replace the affected pages or upload the corrected full version.  Its file name will indicate that it is a "corrected" or "updated" one.  The new copy of the thesis will then become the visible version.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you correcting typographical errors, contact the library and explain the changes to be made.  You will most likely be asked to send a PDF copy of the specific pages with the corrections inserted.  The library, at its discretion, may decide to simply replace the pages in the original document, or dark-archive the original and display a corrected version.
           </li>
           <li>
            Rather than replace the pages, you also have the option of having an Errata PDF document added to the files for your thesis.  This can be done after you have received the requisite permissions from the Committee and Graduate office.  You may contact the library for help in adding the Errata document.

              DO NOT CREATE a new version of the original record in CaltechTHESIS. We will have to transfer all your changes from the new to the original record, and delete the new version. This slows everything down for everyone.
