           How can I borrow items from the library?
          </p>
          <p>
           If you are a member of the Caltech community, you will automatically have borrowing privileges connected to your account, but you must log in to the Library Catalog once to activate them. You will not be able to check out materials from the Library until you do so.

           How can I access electronic resources from on- and off-campus?
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom:10px">
           You can access electronic resources (e-books, journals, and databases) on-campus by logging into a campus computer with your access.caltech credentials. If you are off campus, you will be prompted to log into the library proxy when accessing electronic resources through library website or catalog links. Only current Caltech students, faculty, and staff have remote-access privileges to Caltech-licensed library resources. More information about off-campus access can be found

           How do I know to which journals Caltech subscribes?
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom:10px">
           A listing of electronic journals can be searched
           <a href="https://www.library.caltech.edu/ejournals" target="_blank">
            here
           </a>
           . PLEASE NOTE: For some journals, we may not have older (pre-1997 or thereabouts) issues online - search the
           <a href="https://caltech.tind.io/" target="_blank">
            Library Catalog

           to see if we have older issues in print.

           How do I know what books are in the Library?
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom:10px">
           Print books and journals that the Library owns, along with electronic books and journals to which the Library subscribes, can be found by searching the

           What if the library doesn't have the book or journal article I need?
          </p>
          <p style="padding-bottom:10px">
           You can request book loans or electronic copies of journal articles and other publications via

            DocuServe
           </a>
           . There is no charge to request items to which we do not have access (journal articles, book chapters, physical book loans, etc.), or to have Library Staff scan items which are in the Library collection. Requests for theses, patents, technical reports, and standards may still be subject to a cost, and this can be charged to either a PTA account or your Bursar account if you are a student (enter your UID).
