           we're taking to include folks of all races, genders, sexualities, disabilities (apparent and non-apparent), neurodiversities, ages, cultures and nationalities. Much, but not all, of this work is being done by two groups within the library: the Inclusion and Social Justice Team and the Accessibility Committee.

           We recognize that equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging are core to the mission of the Caltech Library. Equity goes beyond equality and means fair and impartial access to our collections and services for the entire Caltech community. Diversity means all of the various ways the members of our community are unique; it includes but is not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, and national origin. Inclusion means embracing all members of our community as part of a greater whole. Belonging means full acceptance of the members of our community and celebrating them for the richness their experiences bring to our collective work. These values are the primary guiding principle in our work, and they are both individual responsibilities and institutional imperatives.

           Most of the collaborators responsible for this guide in its original form are cisgender white women who benefit from the white supremacist systems and types of oppression outlined in this guide. There are limits and hidden biases at work that stem from our privileges and perspectives. We have attempted to bring together relevant resources on anti-racist issues for the Caltech community, and we welcome feedback and suggestions for the guide, particularly from the perspectives and experiences of Black, Indigenous, and non-Black People of Color (BIPOC) from the Caltech community.
