              Yes. Having an ORCID cannot prevent these problems, but it can make them easier to detect, since, unlike names, your ORCID is unique to you. ORCID is simply a registry of scholarship. You can clean up your profile by identifying your own research and deleting any entries that are not your work.

              Initially, you can populate your profile with articles in other databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed Central, CrossRef Metadata Search, and works already associated with an Thomson Reuters' ResearcherID. Select from these options under "For Researchers -&gt; My ORCID Record" in the "Works" area. Click on "Import Works" to get started. Only articles with a DOI will appear automatically. Other research aggregators such as ADS, ArXiv, and ProQuest also plan to work with ORCID in the near future.
