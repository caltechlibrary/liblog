            <strong>
             1. When was Caltech founded?
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Caltech was founded in 1891 as Throop University by Amos Gager Throop (pronounced T-R-O-O-P). The name was changed to Throop Polytechnic Institute (1893-1912) and then to Throop College of Technology (1913-1919).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             2. When did Caltech receive its present name?
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Caltech became the California Institute of Technology on February 10, 1920.

            <strong>
             3. Where was Caltech's first campus?
            </strong>
            <br/>
            In its first year, 1891, the school occupied rented quarters in the Wooster Block—a building which still stands on the southeast corner of the intersection of Fair Oaks and Green Street. In 1892 the campus was moved to a site bordered by Raymond Avenue to the west and Chestnut Street to the south. This location today is across Raymond Avenue from St. Andrew's Church and bordered on the north by the 210 Freeway. In 1910, with the building of Throop Hall by the architects Elmer Grey and Myron Hunt on the present site, the old campus buildings were leased and then finally demolished in the 1920s.

             Linus Pauling:
            </strong>
            After receiving his PhD from Caltech in physical chemistry and mathematical physics in 1925, two years later he accepted a position here as an assistant professor in theoretical chemistry. It would be the work done here at Caltech regarding the nature of chemical bonding and the structure of the atomic nucleus that would lead to his being awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1954. And in 1962, he would also receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work against above ground nuclear testing. Pauling’s forty-one year association with Caltech—both as a student and professor—would end in 1963 with his resignation.

             13. What is JPL and how is it connected to Caltech?
            </strong>
            <br/>
            The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center managed and operated by Caltech under a contract from NASA, a partnership that began in 1958. Its history can be traced back to 1936, when the first set of rocket experiments were carried out in the Arroyo Seco, located north of Los Angeles. Today, its primary function is the construction and operation of robotic planetary spacecraft, as well as to conduct Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. JPL-run projects have included: the Ranger and Surveyor missions to the moon; the Mariner missions to Venus, Mars, and Mercury; the Galileo mission to Jupiter and its moons; and the Mars rovers.

             14. What is GALCIT?
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Originally, the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech (GALCIT) was a research institute created in 1928 with funds provided by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. In 1930, Theodore von Karman was invited to become its first director, until his retirement in 1949. In 1936, GALCIT’s Rocket Research Project was created, which led to US government financial support in 1939 to research rocket-assisted take-off of aircraft. Starting in 1943, the Army Air Force asked GALCIT to study the possible use of rockets to propel long-range missiles as well as develop missiles for field use—work that would lead to the eventual development of the Private, Corporal, and Sargeant missiles. In 1961 the name was changed when two new laboratories, the Firestone Flight Sciences Laboratory and the Karman Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Jet Propulsion were established, thus creating the new GALCIT—Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology.
