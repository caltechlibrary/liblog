           A requirement of all PhD programs at Caltech is that the student must prepare, submit, and successfully defend in an oral examination a written dissertation, known in the vernacular as a "thesis".
          </p>

           Caltech theses have a common format and there are regulations regarding the contents, submission, proofreading, and final disposition.  Please use the Grad Office's "

           Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the regulations, following the correct format, meeting deadlines, working with their advisor and dissertation committee to schedule the examination, providing timely copies of the thesis, and making requested revisions.
