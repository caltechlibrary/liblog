           Many journal publishers do analyze submitted manuscripts using the iThenticate service, including the American Physical Society (APS), IEEE, Springer-Nature, Elsevier, Public Library of Science (PLoS), and many others. The version of iThenticate that the publishers use is commonly called "CrossCheck", and is part of the publisher services that the DOI Registration Agency CrossRef offers as a value added benefit. When publishers register a DOI for a given article, they submit it for iThenticate similarity checking and also agree to add the published article to the iThenticate database. In this way, the iThenticate database of content being checked for similarity is continuously updated with new papers, proceedings, and books/book chapters.

           if you wish to know whether a particular publication is included in the iThenticate database, visit the online page at

            https://www.ithenticate.com/search?q=
           </a>
           and type in the title of interest in the the ‘search scholarly journals’ box in the middle of the page (example shown below). If the database includes the journal, the results will display the name of the journal, the publisher, and the number of articles that iThenticate includes.

           According to a study commissioned by the international

            Committee on Publication Ethics
           </a>
           (COPE), over 40% of journal editors worldwide screen manuscript submissions against the iThenticate database. They do this via the

            CrossCheck

           An example of a publisher's policies using CrossCheck/iThenticate is available in the

           In another example, Elsevier has integrated CrossCheck and iThenticate into their editorial submission system to ensure that all manuscripts are checked. Yet Elsevier editors understand the importance of combining the generated similarity reports with sound judgment. As explained by one of their editors-in-chief, commenting in "
