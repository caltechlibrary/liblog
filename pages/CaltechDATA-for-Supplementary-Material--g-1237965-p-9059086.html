            Caltech Library encourages you to share data files, software, and other supplemental material, along with the text of your thesis.

             CaltechDATA

            is a resource you can use to preserve any type of file as you write your thesis.

          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            You will need to provide basic information about the files, such as the authors and how another researcher could use them.
           </li>
           <li>
            Items in CaltechDATA are organized into records, which can contain multiple files.
           </li>
           <li>
            You could have one record per chapter, one record for raw and one for processed data, or many different records.
           </li>
           <li>
            Each record is assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which will always link to the files.
           </li>
          </ul>

          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            You can submit files to CaltechDATA before your thesis is completed and embargo the files until your thesis is released.
           </li>
           <li>
            You can adjust the embargo date (as well as other metadata) at any time until the files are made public.
           </li>
           <li>
            Although you cannot change files once they have been uploaded to CaltechDATA, you may want to replace embargoed files with a new version.  Email

            GitHub and CaltechDATA
           </strong>

          <p>
           If you use
           <strong>
            GitHub
           </strong>
           to manage software, CaltechDATA has an integration to automatically preserve your software.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            After logging into CaltechDATA, go to your profile and select GitHub.
           </li>
           <li>
            Follow the instructions to link your GitHub account, and you'll get a list of your public GitHub repositories.
           </li>
           <li>
            Check the repositories you are interested in preserving, and when you do a software release in GitHub a copy of the software will be saved in CaltechDATA.
           </li>
           <li>
            You'll also get a DOI that you can use to refer to the specific software version.
