            Commands
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Commands are a vital structure for creating any kind of document in LaTeX.  Commands have many uses such as changing document/text formatting, creating equations, delineating sections of a document, and inputting symbols.  To use a command a back slash is placed before the command.  For example
           <strong>
            \pi
           </strong>
           is the command to insert the symbol π and
           <strong>
            \begin{matrix}
           </strong>
           is one of the commands needed to input a matrix.  Generally commands have the format
           <strong>
            \command[optional argument]{required argument}
           </strong>
           . Multiple arguments can be used with some commands by separating each argument with a comma, for example
           <strong>
            \hypersetup{colorlinks=true, linkcolor=blue, urlcolor=blue}
           </strong>
           sets the font color of certain hyperlinks in a document.  Some commands such as
           <strong>
            \pi
           </strong>
           have neither a optional nor required argument.  Others such as
           <strong>
            \begin{}
           </strong>
           will only work with a recognized required argument.  Some commands can also accept an optional argument which is used to specify what action the command will take, for example
           <strong>
            \documentclass[11pt, twocolumn]{article}
           </strong>
           tells LaTeX that the current project is an article with 11pt font and should be formatted with two columns, leaving out the optional argument,
           <strong>
            \documentclass{article}
           </strong>
           , will cause LaTeX to use the defaults associated with this command  Lastly, some commands may have more than one required argument for example
           <strong>
            \frac{numerator}{denominator}
           </strong>
           creates a faction where the first argument is the numerator and the second argument is the denominator.  A list of common commands can be seen in the
           <strong>
            Common Commands
           </strong>
           section of this page, there are also links to several useful websites with lists of commands in the

            Packages
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Packages are used to supplement the standard features of LaTeX.  If you are trying to use a command and find that it is generating an error one of the most common issues is that you have not included the needed package in your document.  The command
           <strong>
            \usepackage{}
           </strong>
           with the package name as the argument will tell LaTeX to include a certain package in your document. Packages should be placed in the document preamble (see
           <strong>
            Document Structure
           </strong>
           below).  If you would like to include multiple packages in your document you can either include the
           <strong>
            \usepackage{}
           </strong>
           command multiple times or use it once and separate each package name with a comma i.e.:
          </p>
          <p>
           \usepackage{geometry}
          </p>
          <p>
           \usepackage{amsmath}                                  \usepackage{geometry, amsmath, graphicx}
          </p>
          <p>
           \usepackage{graphicx}
          </p>
          <p>
           It is better to list the packages separately if you intend to use an optional argument with any package, otherwise it just comes down to personal preference.  Many standard packages come with a MikTex or MacTex download, but you can also install new ones if needed.  Some instruction for

            Document Structure

          <p>
           To create PDFs with LaTeX the user must generate a .tex file. The .tex file will consist of the code that is compiled by the back end LaTeX software to generate the end result PDF document. With LaTeX installed .tex files can be created in notepad or textedit on Windows or OS X computers respectively, though it is strongly recommenced to generate these files directly in a LaTeX text editor.
          </p>
          <p>
           A LaTeX document consists of two main pieces, the
           <strong>
            preamble
           </strong>
           and the
           <strong>
            body
           </strong>
           , the bibliography can be considered a third piece depending on how you structure it. It is recommended that the user creates a new folder on their computer for each LaTeX document they are working on.  When LaTeX compiles a .tex file it generates several files in order to create the PDF having a folder for the each individual document you are working on will help keep all of the files generated organized.  Additionally, it possible the user will want to insert images, figures, or other objects into their document (BibTex files for example), it is much simpler to insert items into the document when they are located in the same folder as the .tex file.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Preamble
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The preamble to a LaTeX document is all the information that occurs before the document begins.  The preamble starts with the command
           <strong>
            \documentclass{}
           </strong>
           and ends with the command
           <strong>
            \begin{document}
           </strong>
           .  Below is an image of a document preamble:
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="Image of LaTeX code showing the preamble of a document. " loading="lazy" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/libapps/accounts/109251/images/Screen_Shot_2016-12-23_at_1.25.32_PM.png"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           Different objects are placed in the preamble between the commands
           <strong>
            \documentclass{}
           </strong>
           and
           <strong>
            \begin{document}
           </strong>
           .  The most common of these items is the command
           <strong>
            \usepackage{}
           </strong>
           .  A more detailed explanation of what packages are can be found under the
           <strong>
            LaTeX Structures
           </strong>
           heading on this page, but briefly a package informs the compiler of certain commands that will be used and certain procedures to take while generating the final document.  Any number of packages can be included in the preamble, and one of the most common mistakes made by the new LaTeX user is to include a command in their document without including the proper package in the preamble.  Other commands such as
           <strong>
            \title
           </strong>
           ,
           <strong>
            \author
           </strong>
           , and
           <strong>
            \date
           </strong>
           are included in the preamble and than may be incorporated within the document.  Lastly, new commands can be created in the preamble that will only be used in the current document.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Body
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The body of a LaTeX document is where all of the text, equations, figures, tables, etc... will be placed.  The body of the document begins with the command
           <strong>
            \begin{document}
           </strong>
           and ends with the command
           <strong>
            \end{document}
           </strong>
           .  A very simple sample code and its output can be seen below.  The code contains both the preamble and body of the document.

            Writing Math
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the most popular features of LaTeX is its ability to easily incorporate and format mathematical equations and symbols.  There are two important things to remember to ensure LaTeX handles mathematical formula properly.
          </p>
          <p>
           First is to make sure that you have included all necessary packages.  The most common package for using mathematical formulas in a document is "amsmath", though this package allows the use of a multitude of mathematical symbols and commands it does not include everything.  If you try to compile a document and an error occurs related to a mathematical object you have included you will want to check if there is an additional package you need, for example if you try to include bold lettering in a mathematical equation without the package "bm" an error will occur.
          </p>
          <p>
           Second is to entire
           <strong>
            math mode
           </strong>
           .  Math mode lets LaTeX know that something should be formatted as math and not regular text, there are also some symbols and commands that can not be used outside of math mode.  The image below shows the same text, f(x) = 2x+5, first not using math mode and second using it.  There is a very clear difference between how the equation is formatted inside and outside of math mode.
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="Image comparing mathematics written in and out of LaTeX's math mode" loading="lazy" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/libapps/accounts/109251/images/Screen_Shot_2016-12-23_at_2.19.08_PM.png"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           There are several different ways to enter math mode.  If you would like to write mathematical expression inside a line of text all the mathematical text should be book ended by
           <strong>
            $
           </strong>
           .  For example writing $x+3$ would tell LaTeX to write x+3 as math. If you want math to appear on its own line it what is called display mode you can use either the command
           <strong>
            $$
           </strong>
           on both sides of the math, or
           <strong>
            \[
           </strong>
           and
           <strong>
            \]
           </strong>
           .  The previous example would look like this: $$x+3$$ or \[x+3\].  Finally, some commands will automatically place the user in math mode for example any text appearing between the commands
           <strong>
            \begin{equation}
           </strong>
           and
           <strong>
            \end{equation}
           </strong>
           will be written in math mode.  Go to the exercises tab for some questions to let you practice using math mode.

           <strong>
            Preamble commands:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            \documentclass{}
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
           The first command in any document.  Used to specify what type of document is being made.  Some common arguments are article (common for scientific journals), book, IEEEtran (for IEEE transaction format), slides, beamer (for presentations).
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            \usepackage{}
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
           This command imports a package into the LaTeX document.  This is important for including any commands that are not standard in LaTeX.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            \title{}
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
           The intended title of the document should be used as the argument
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            \author{}
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
           The author of the document should be used as the argument, for multiple authors use
           <strong>
            \and
           </strong>
           to separate authors name or use the
           <strong>
            authblk
           </strong>
           package.  For the
           <strong>
            authblk
           </strong>
           package uses the following format where
           <strong>
            \affil
           </strong>
           is used to entire the affiliation of the author and the optional argument denotes the whatever symbol should be used after the author's name:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
           \author[1]{1st Author}
           <br/>
           \author[1]{2nd Author}
           <br/>
           \author[1]{3rd Author}
           <br/>
           \author[2]{Nth Author}
           <br/>
           \affil[1]{Institute 1}
           <br/>
           \affil[2]{Institute 2}

           </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
           The argument is the date associated with the document.  Note that leaving the argument empty will create a blank date in the title, and not including the command will default the title to the date compiled.

          </h4>
          <p>
           Since LaTeX is often used to create academic works that will cite many different sources it is important to know how to create a bibliography in LaTeX. With a little practice and the help of a citation management creating LaTeX bibliographies can be very easy.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is strongly recommend that you use a citation management tool, not only to help create LaTeX bibliographies, but to help organize and track articles, books, and other documents throughout your academic career. Caltech offers training and support for Zotero, and more information can be found on our
           <a href="https://libguides.caltech.edu/citation-management">

           .

          <p>
           <strong>
            Important note:
           </strong>
           When creating a bibliography you will need to compile the document twice in order to create properly formatted references.

           <strong>
            Creating a Bibliography
           </strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
           There are two parts to creating a bibliography in a LaTeX document.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Part one
           </strong>
           is the creation of a separate
           <strong>
            .bib
           </strong>
           file. This file contains all of the citation information (i.e. title, author, publication date, publisher, etc...), as will as, a
           <strong>
            bibID
           </strong>
           for each citation.  It is strongly recommended to use a citation management tool to create your
           <strong>
            .bib
           </strong>
           files.  Those tools will greatly speed up the process and help keep the file organized, generate automatic
           <strong>
            bibIDs (
           </strong>
           which can be edited if desired), and auto fill all relevant data fields which will prevent typos or bugs within the file.  Below is an example of the
           <strong>
            .bib
           </strong>
           format for four different common references if you choose to entire them yourself.
           <strong>
            Note that not all fields are required and any unused field should be deleted
           </strong>
           .  The
           <strong>
            bibID
           </strong>
           is what is used in the main LaTeX document to create in-line references as well as completed bibliographies.  When creating the final bibliography LaTeX will only include citations that were referenced in the document, so its ok to have unused citations in your
           <strong>
            .bib
           </strong>
           file.

            Part two
           </strong>
           is integrating the information from the.bib file into your main LaTeX document.  The three ways for doing so are using
           <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibliography_management_with_bibtex">
            BibTex
           </a>
           ,
           <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibliography_management_with_natbib">
            BibTex with natbib
           </a>
           , or
           <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX">
            BibLaTeX
           </a>
           .  The hyperlinks will take you to explanation of each method from sharelatex.com.  Both BibTex with natbib and BibLaTeX have the advantage of optional arguments because they require a
           <strong>
            \usepackage[]{}
           </strong>
           command.  These optional arguments can be used to fine tune how references appear throughout the document and the formatting of the bibliography.  Below is a table that highlights some of the important difference for each method.
