            If the thesis consists of relative independent chapters, a unifying summary should be included at the end or beginning of the thesis. Such a summary will generally be quite different in style and length than the abstract.

            What is a graduate thesis?
           </strong>
          </h5>
          <p>
           The PhD Dissertation, Engineer's Thesis, or Masters Thesis, is a document prepared by the candidate and represents an exposition of the candidate’s research topic and findings. There are specific requirements for format as well as the process of thesis acceptance, but the content and length are flexible and vary substantially between individual candidates. The expectation by the faculty and the Dean of Graduate Studies is that the thesis should represent independent work by the candidate and meet the highest standards of scholarship as well as written expression. The Dean relies on the candidate, the advisor, and thesis committee to uphold these standards.
