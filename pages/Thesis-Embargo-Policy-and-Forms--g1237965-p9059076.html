            Yes! You may embargo either your full thesis file, and/or separate thesis chapter files.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If you are interested in restricting access to your thesis, ask yourself if you only need to embargo certain portions of your thesis. You may not need to embargo the whole thesis.
           </li>
           <li>
            If a partial embargo will do, you have two choices in uploading your files:
            <ul>
             <li>
              Upload both your full thesis file AND a redacted thesis file.
              <ul>
               <li>
                The redacted thesis file can have the relevant material omitted.  On the page in the thesis where the omitted content would normally be, and add a statement to the reader saying something like "[This chapter is temporarily embargoed.]" or "[Intentionally redacted.]"
               </li>
              </ul>
             </li>
             <li>
              Specific chapter files can each have different embargo types and lengths.
              <ul>
               <li>
                Embargo levels for attached files in a CaltechTHESIS record do not need to match: each file can be either public, restricted to campus, or fully embargoed. For example, ch.1 could be publicly available, ch.2-3 could be restricted to campus, and ch.4 could be fully embargoed.
               </li>
              </ul>
             </li>
             <li>
              The full thesis file's embargo status will always match that of the most restrictive embargo status of any of the other chapter files at any given time over the lifetime of the embargo.
             </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
            The full thesis will not become publicly available until the last of the restricted chapter files have been publicly released.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Notify the Thesis Embargo Review Committee of your Intentions:

          <ul>
           <li>

            If you anticipate needing to extend your accepted embargo, we highly recommend that you upload both a full thesis file as well as separate chapter files, into your CaltechTHESIS record.  This will make it easier to release portions of the thesis that no longer need to be embargoed during the extension period.

            If your embargo request is denied by the Embargo Review Committee, you may appeal the decision.  You must send your appeal request in writing, and it will be forwarded to the Committee for consideration.  It is highly recommended that any new and additional information that could boost your case be provided in the Reasons field.
           </li>
           <li>
            If your initial full embargo request is not approved and an appeal has not been submitted, your thesis file(s)’ access status will be changed to Restricted to Campus-Only for the same 6-months length of time.  You and your advisor(s) will be notified of the change.
           </li>
           <li>
            If your request for an embargo extension is not approved and an appeal has not been submitted, your thesis' embargo status will be moved down to the next level, whichever is appropriate: from Full Embargo to Campus-Access-Only, or from Campus-Access-Only to Public Access. You and your advisor(s) will be notified of the change.
           </li>
           <li>
            If an appeal has been submitted, the thesis' current embargo status will remain unchanged while the appeal is under review.  You will be notified when the decision has been made by the Embargo Review Committee.
           </li>
           <li>
            Both the student and the advisor must agree on the need for the appeal.

           The Thesis Embargo Review Committee includes the University Librarian, the director of the Office of Technology Transfer and Corporate Partnerships (OTTCP) as needed, the student's Division Chair, the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Vice-Provost.  Unanimous approval from the Committee is needed for requests for a full embargo, an extension of a current embargo, or an appeal of a denied request.
