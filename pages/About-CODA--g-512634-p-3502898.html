His scientific work transitioned then to molecular biology and later to neuroscience, leading to significant contributions in both fields. The Glaser Digital Collection unites two physical collections owned by the University of California, Berkeley and Caltech. It is extremely rich and significant and includes papers, diaries, notebooks, many photos and slides.

              George E. Hale (1868-1938) was an influential astrophysicist and scientific administrator. He quickly established a distinguished scientific reputation for his invention of the spectroheliograph, then made important contributions to the study of solar phenomena. He was the leading figure in the founding of the Kenwood, Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories as well as the California institute of Technology, Huntington Library and the National Research Council.

              The Caltech Archives Oral History Project began in 1978 for the purpose of recording the personal memoirs of the distinguished scientists, teachers and administrators of the Institute. To date, approximately 170 interviews have been completed and most are open to readers in transcript form. Oral Histories Online, begun in the fall of 2002, brings selected interviews to the public in digital form, chosen from the fields of biology and environmental science.

           The archives are compliant with the Open Access Initiative-Metadata Harvesting Protocol (OAI-PMH), which makes them visible in “deep web” search engines (e.g. OAIster, D9). In addition to accessing the archives directly from the Caltech CODA website, the major general web search engines (Google Scholar, Scopus, and MSN Search, among others) routinely index the site.

            The mission of the Caltech Collection of Open Digital Archives is to collect, manage, preserve and provide global access over time to the scholarly output of the Institute and the publications of campus units.

           CODA as a whole has been active since 2001.  CaltechAUTHORS and CaltechTHESIS are the largest and most dynamic repositories within CODA.

           Some items have access restrictions. The largest class of material with access restricted to the Caltech campus are dissertations written since 1977, in cases where the author has not yet been contacted to secure permission for global distribution.The library responds to all requests for access by contacting the author or the author's heirs in pursuit of that permission.

           On March 16, 2009, the Faculty Board unanimously approved a motion that Caltech Faculty support the creation of the Caltech Collection, and that the library be charged to create and maintain this collection.

           The Ad hoc Committee on Scholarly Output And Distribution recommended the following:

           <li>
            <font color="#808080">
             The Institute should create a Caltech Collection of the published scholarship and research of the Caltech community.

           <li>
            <font color="#808080">
             With the support and cooperation of the Caltech faculty, the library will collect into the Archive a record of all papers originating from Caltech.

           <li>
            <font color="#808080">
             The library will aim to acquire the final version of each paper and make it as freely available on the global [web] as the law allows.

            Studies show that the increased visibility of openly accessible papers leads to greater uptake in a broad range of human activities. The committee believes that the establishment of a Caltech Collection is valuable because:

            In addition, implementation will be seamless: the necessary resources are already in place, and papers will be added to the collection using library procedures that are already being used.
