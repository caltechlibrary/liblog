           The Friends of the Caltech Libraries Senior Thesis Prize 2022
          </h4>
          <p>
           The Friends of the Caltech Libraries created the prize in 2010 to recognize senior theses that exemplify research and the effective use of the scholarly record. The thesis is an extensive, independent written work produced during the senior year, usually within a senior thesis course series. The University Librarian and the Friends of the Caltech Libraries oversee evaluation and make recommendations to the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee (UASH) for final selection. An oral presentation may be requested. At the discretion of the Friends of the Caltech Libraries, more than one award, or none, may be made in any year. Finalists are honored with a reception hosted by the Friends of the Caltech Libraries and receive acknowledgment of their finalist status on their official transcript.  The citation is accompanied by a $1200 honorarium and appears in the Commencement program.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finalist theses will be deposited in the CaltechTHESIS digital repository.
