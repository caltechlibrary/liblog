             </p>
             <p>
              Answer one of the following questions in a paper of 1500 to 3000 words (~5 - 10 double spaced pages?), drawing on material from both the relevant readings and the lectures as you think necessary:
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              1.     The Anglo-Saxon poem
              <em>
               Beowulf
              </em>
              survives in a single manuscript that was written in England around the year 1000. In our discussion of the text, I said several times that it represents a long oral tradition that goes back to the north German/south Scandinavian world of the sixth century AD. Please write a paper that talks about the evidence supporting this claim; explore not only the evidence that the story’s roots are old, but also the evidence that the Anglo-Saxon poet who wrote the poem was grappling with an older worldview and with older cultural traditions that were somehow different from those of his own society. In other words, why we should think that
              <em>
               Beowulf
              </em>
              gives us any information at all about N. Germanic/S. Scandinavian culture in the pre-Viking period?
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              2.     In the
              <em>
               Saga of the Volsungs
              </em>
              , is violence good or bad? Why? In other words, describe for me, with supporting evidence, the value system (or systems?) by which the saga judges violence.
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              3.     This question is for those of you who are familiar with J.R.R. Tolkein’s
              <em>
               Lord of the Rings
              </em>
              trilogy. The cover of our edition of the
              <em>
               Saga of the Volsungs
              </em>
              asserts that it was Tolkien’s source for
              <em>
               Lord of the Rings
              </em>
              . To what degree do you think this is true? Show me where and how Tolkien drew on the saga, and/or where and how he did not. Do you think that the
              <em>
               Volsungssaga
              </em>
              was his only source, as the cover implies?
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              4.     Forget Jesse Byock’s Burgundians, Huns, Franks, etc. as he presents them in his introduction to the
              <em>
               Saga of the Volsungs
              </em>
              . How does the
              <em>
               Saga
              </em>
              imagine its characters’ identities? How do people identify themselves individually and as members of groups, both in space and time? Finally, how do you explain the difference between the way Byock presents the historical people and groups behind the story and the way the saga itself describes them?
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              5.
              <em>
               Beowulf
              </em>
              and the
              <em>
               Saga of the Volsungs
              </em>
              deal not only with men, of course, but also with women. Discuss and compare the images of women projected by the two works. Are they similar? Different? Can you try to explain your answers?

              6.     In the
              <em>
               Royal Frankish Annals
              </em>
              up through 830, take a look at the bad guys. According to the annals, what sorts of things do the enemies of the Carolingian rulers do that make it right for the Carolingians to attack them? Why do the bad guys (as opposed to the Carolingians) resort to violence or cause wars? Why do the Carolingians? How do your answers compare to what we see in the
              <em>
               Volsungssaga
              </em>
              and/or

             <p>
              Answer one of the following questions in a paper of 1500 to 3000 words (~5-10 double-spaced pages?), drawing on material from both the relevant readings and the lectures as you think necessary:
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               Review the Annals of St. Bertin in their entirety (they end in 882). What sorts of things were the annalists who compiled/continued them preoccupied with, and how did their preoccupations change over time? How do the Northmen fit in to the annalists’ preoccupations? Why were the Northmen important (when they were important) and how did their importance evolve or change depending on time, circumstance and/or the purposes of a particular annalist?
              </li>
              <li value="2">
               We have spent a good deal of our time in this course trying to explain the Vikings. Looking over all of the non-Scandinavian sources we have read over the last few weeks (the Annals of St. Bertin, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Asser’s Life of Alfred, the Annals of Ulster), how do their authors explain the Vikings? Are their explanations the same, or do they differ from one source to another, or even within a given source?
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              A sub-question that then follows is this: if you can come up with reasonably coherent answers to the above, does this do it for us? Why should we look any farther? Why should we not take the understanding expressed by these contemporary sources, written by people who actually dealt with Vikings or knew people who had, at face value?
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li value="3">
               Egil’s Saga: we have tried to decide what relationship this 13th century Icelandic Saga bears to the Viking world of the 9th and 10th centuries. We do have some other sources for the period, however: Othere’s report to King Alfred the Great comes from a late 9th century Norwegian; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, Asser’s Life of Alfred, and the Annals of Ulster (although we have read the latter only up to 865) all deal with the same greater Norwegian/English/British/Irish world in which Egil’s Saga is played out. What from these sources fits with Egil’s Saga and what does not? From your observations, can you make an argument for the Saga’s reliability as a source for the 9th and 10th centuries?

                In our discussion of the Greenlanders Saga and Eirik the Red’s Saga, we did not have the time to discuss a very important element of both stories, namely Christianity. What role does Christianity play in these sagas? What does it look like, and how and why did people convert to it? How do the sagas represent old Norse paganism and Christianity’s relationship to it? Finally, are the answers the same or different for each of the sagas? If different, how might you explain the differences?

                </i>
                , were all written down in Iceland in the 12

                was written down in England around the turn of the eleventh century. I had you read them to help you understand Scandinavian culture and behavior along a timeline stretching from the pre-Viking period to the eleventh century. Read in the sequence in which I gave them to you, these texts appear to give us evidence for change over time. Are we in fact entitled to use them as evidence for change over time just because the stories they tell cover successively later periods? Or have I misled you by giving them to you in the order that I did?

                In the last decade, an economic theory of state development has been proposed that attributes the development of stable states to a transition from “roving” banditry to “stationary” banditry. The theory goes something like this: roving banditry, i.e., looting targets and then leaving, works for awhile, but then becomes unprofitable as targets run dry, as the people who live in them learn to hide their valuables, as other bandits hear about your targets and start to compete with you, etc. So it eventually occurs to you to stay put, that is, set up a protection racket around a specific target, or set of targets, and rob in an ongoing way, through payments, or tolls, or taxes. It is then in your interest to protect your targets’ ability to pay by providing them with the stability, infrastructure, laws, etc. to generate wealth that you can profit from.

              <span style="font-size: medium;">
               This theory has been applied to Vikings, and suggested as an explanation for the development of Viking raiding and settlement. To quote one paper, “Our contribution is to present a theoretical model of Viking behavior, which draws attention to the possibility that the Vikings were simply reacting rationally to changes in constraints and as entrepreneurially exploiting opportunities.”

               You have read some of the primary sources on Vikings, and have some idea of Viking archeology. Is this model sufficient to explain the Vikings? (note: if you would find it helpful, I can give you the paper that lays out this model as it specifically applies to Vikings).

                The “Viking Age” is generally reckoned to have lasted from the first raids on Britain in the 780’s to the death of Harald Hardrada at Stamford Bridge in 1066; the Scandinavians who lived, acted, and died during this period are often subsumed under the label “Viking.” Do you agree that the period deserves the label “Viking Age,” and that we are entitled to think of all Scandinavians living in the period as Vikings?
