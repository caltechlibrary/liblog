               Members of the Caltech community are familiar with using the “CaltechConnect” button to connect to Library-provided electronic resources. Over time, other “Caltech Connect” services have been provided on campus. To distinguish this Library service from the others, we are excited to announce “Get It @ Caltech”!

              <p dir="ltr">
               The Caltech Library has undergone a year-long makeover and we’re ready for our close-up with the new website redesign that launches this week.
              </p>
              <p>
               Over the past academic year, the Library has implemented significant changes to the services we offer our patrons. In the fall 2021 term, the Library debuted LibSearch, a new catalog that brought together most of the library’s collections into a single interface, including books, ebooks, journal articles, Archives, repositories like CaltechAUTHORS, and more. Once that project was up and running, it was time to make the rest of the Library website equally efficient and responsive—not to mention attractive.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since the beginning of 2022, our website redesign team—project manager Melissa Johnson (who also helped manage the LibSearch implementation), programming lead Tommy Keswick, and design lead Chris Daley—have been building the new website from the ground up. Now we’re pleased to share the streamlined and stylish results. We invite patrons to explore the new website’s best features:
              </p>
              <p>
              </p>
              <h4 dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               Improved navigation
              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The team restructured the organization of our previous website with a focus on action-based menu categories, informed by user testing with Caltech students and faculty. We now have five main color-coded categories that make our services and resources easier to find and discover. The team also added landing pages at each subsection that orient patrons with brief descriptions of what they will find there.

               Archives integration
              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The integration of the Caltech Archives &amp; Special Collections into the Library platform, when they previously had a stand-alone website, was an exciting and overdue development. The Caltech Archives is now part of the Library web ecosystem and its new home features improved architecture and aesthetics.

              <h4 dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               Vibrant visual interface
              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The team approached the redesign of our previous website with an eye to making it both easy and enjoyable to use. Images, colors, typeface, and graphics were chosen or modified to make the website more visually pleasing. An improved mobile design also enhances the user experience.

              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The Library seeks to promote equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging for all members of the Caltech community in all of our collections and services. With these goals in mind, the website redesign team considered improved accessibility at every step of the process. The team also redesigned the home page to allow the Library to share more news, events, and featured resources.

              <h4 dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">

              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               An extensive “spring cleaning” content audit of over 500 pages reduced redundancy and complexity, integrated Library research guides with webpages, and fortified our search results to fully include databases, FAQs, site info, and research guides.
              </p>
              <h4 dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               Benefits to Library staff
              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               Choosing the LibGuides content management system improved efficiency for our Library staff due to integration with other Springshare products we already used. We also simplified content editing due to reduction from three disparate web content systems to the one we now present to our patrons.

               . Knauss, who is internationally known for his pioneering research in fracture mechanics, talks about Caltech’s GALCIT program, his work with NASA, the aerospace industry, and the US Navy, and his lifelong interest in music, among many other topics. Born in Germany in 1933, the year Hitler came to power, he also recalls

               June 11, 2022
              </span>
              <br/>
              <p>
              </p>
              <p>
               Since late April, Iris Shih has played an integral role in the RFID tagging and encoding project at Sherman-Fairchild Library.
              </p>
              <p>
               A Pasadena native, Iris has personal associations with Caltech that go back to her childhood. She sat down to talk about the trajectory that led her to library services after working for years as a chemistry teacher.
              </p>
              <p>
               “My dad came here for his aeronautic engineering Ph.D., and I believe my mom’s eldest brother and his wife might also have done a postdoc here at Caltech. So that’s how my mom and dad met.” Iris’ father went on to a career at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which included taking part in the launching of the Mars Pathfinder.
              </p>
              <p>
               Iris recalled visiting the JPL as a child and using the Caltech sports facilities as a teenager. “My dad’s hobbies were basketball and jogging. We spent many afternoons on the Caltech track or in the gymnasium. When I got older—middle school and high school—I practiced [baton] twirling while he played basketball. So we shared the old gym.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Although she cites chemistry as her favorite science, Iris studied psychobiology at UCLA and materials engineering at CSU Northridge. Interested in public speaking, she enrolled in an education series that led to considerable experience as a tutor and lecturer.
              </p>
              <p>
               “I tutored the first-year chemistry series at UCLA. I got very used to teaching twenty-five to forty students… I think people are always surprised that I don’t have a degree in chemistry, but that is actually where my subject expertise is, because all of my career I’ve written curriculum for chemistry.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Graduating in 2010, Iris went on to teach high school chemistry for several years, including under her former AP Chem teacher. Although she is passionate about higher education, she felt discouraged by the prospect of earning a Ph.D. “I think when I got out of teaching and considered what I could get into, the draw of libraries was that they were service-oriented and community based. I particularly like the sound of reference services and circulation because you get more student and faculty interaction. That always appealed to me.”
              </p>
              <p>
               In 2020, coinciding with the beginning of the pandemic, she decided to leave teaching and pursue library services. “I think because of all I wanted to do as a teacher, it became untenable. I was working eighty hours a week… Every few years I would stop and reassess. My entire life I identified as a teacher. What will I be without that? And that has been a really hard transition… After I tried everything and I knew it was time, I was still crying my eyes out.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Despite that, Iris is quick to express excitement about working at her dad’s alma mater. “Caltech has always been somewhat of a dream for me. It definitely reminds me of home… I think Caltech is one of those cornerstones in my life.”
