               Wendy Maciel began her internship at Sherman Fairchild Library in June and has been invaluable in completing the RFID tagging project. She graciously set aside time to discuss what it means to her to be working in library services and what led her here.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wendy, the first member of her family to be born in the United States, grew up in the town of Maywood in Southeast Los Angeles. “So all of the experiences where people say ‘Oh Hollywood!’ or ‘LA is so bougie!’—I don’t know that. Little Mexico is where I grew up, a big Latinx community. It was very big in shaping who I am now.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Libraries have been an important fixture in Wendy’s life as far back as she can recall. At three years old, she was taught to read by her older sister. “I grew up in my public library around my neighborhood. I went to my elementary public school library all the time, volunteered there and at my middle school and high school libraries. I knew even then it was an area where I wanted to work.”
              </p>
              <p>
               When she was considering what to study in college, people were quick to warn her that libraries were “dying” in the digital age. “And I listened,” she recalls. “Not going to blame anybody. Nobody knew what libraries were going to turn into.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Instead she pursued a psychology degree at UC Santa Barbara, but left after struggling to balance work and school. “I was very discouraged because I didn’t have a good experience straight out of high school, which now I know is a very common experience for Latinx first-gen students.” Upon returning home, Wendy went on to work as a sales representative for various companies including AT&amp;T.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wendy used the onset of the pandemic as a motivator to reevaluate her career. She decided to pursue both of her earlier interests. This year, she earned an Associate of Science certificate in library technology at Pasadena City College. She is now completing a BA in psychology at Cal State LA and plans to follow this degree with library school.
              </p>
              <p>
               From talking to her, it’s immediately clear that Wendy is passionate about child development and education. She mentioned the growing trend of public libraries hiring social workers. and emphasized the idea of university libraries as a resource of emotional support for struggling students. She originally wanted to be a children’s librarian in a public school but leans more toward academics now. “I like the atmosphere in academic libraries, and the opportunities that students have here and being a part of that.” She expressed a desire to work in a university library environment where she can also incorporate her psychology background.
              </p>
              <p>
               While working on the tagging and encoding project, Wendy has also received training in cataloging, Docuserve, and book repairs (the latter of which she describes as relaxing and a great way to decompress). She has also expressed interest in electronic resources and digitization. But when asked by SFL staff what else she wants to learn about access services while she’s here, she proclaims, “Everything. Just teach me everything and I will try to absorb as much as I can.”

               This book presents a case for engagement between the sciences and the humanities. The author, a professional chemist, seeks to demonstrate that the connections between those fields of intellectual activity are far more significant than anything that separates them. The book combines a historical survey of the relationships between science and literature with a number of case studies that examine specific scientific episodes—several drawn from the author’s own research—juxtaposed with a variety of literary works spanning a wide range of period and genre—Dante to detective fiction, War and Peace to White Teeth—to elicit their common themes. The work argues for an empirical, non-theory-based approach, one that is closely analogous to connectionist models of brain development and function, and that can appeal to general readers, as well as to literary scholars and practicing scientists, who are open to the idea that literature and science should not be compartmentalized.

                Congratulations on the release of your new book, Connecting Literature and Science. You're the Administrator of the Beckman Institute and you were trained as a chemist. How did you become so interested in literature (and invested enough that you'd write a book about it)?

               I’ve been interested in literature at least as long as in chemistry, but for a long time (until about 30 years ago) I read mostly recreationally.  I think two main influences (books I read) moved me to be more serious about literary scholarship and to explore connections between nominally different realms: Douglas Hofstadter’s

               . The second in particular seemed to speak to me in many ways; I started by writing a review for Engineering &amp; Science, and then discovered the existence of a whole community with like interests, the Society for Literature and Science (it’s since changed its name to the Society for Literature, Science and the Arts). I started going to meetings, reading a lot of works in the field that I heard about, and contributing some talks and essays of my own, which has come to occupy a large fraction (almost all of it, more recently) of my non-administrative time.

                What inspired you to write this book?

              </p>
              <p>
               I’ve produced a number of studies, some published in various places but most just presented at SLSA meetings, not published at all; for the last few years, I was thinking about how they might fit together, hopefully coherently, in a collection. At the same time, my activity in chemistry research was starting to dial down, largely because my main collaborator (John Bercaw) had decided to retire, so it seemed like the right time. Looking back over that earlier work, the theme of finding connections stood out as a sort of guiding principle to how I selected topics, and I decided to try to write a book that would do several things: explain my rationale, survey some of the background and history of work along the boundaries between science and humanities, and present some of those studies (I ended up with seven) both as interesting stories on their own and as exemplars of my approach to the topic. I hoped that would lend some quality of uniqueness, as very few (alas) of those who work in these areas are professional scientists.

                Which texts and authors do you use to explore your ideas? How were they chosen?

              </p>
              <p>
               There has been a large component of serendipity in the selection of topics and works for the individual studies: often a literary work that I happened to read had some interesting science-related content and/or called to mind some particular scientific paper (sometimes one of my own)—or the reverse, a scientific paper reminded me of a literary work; sometimes a group of books that I read in a short period of time (again, largely due to coincidence—no planning usually involved!) seemed to resonate both with each other and with a scientific theme. Thus, for example, during the first few years of the 2000s, I read several books that featured creation of new forms of life (Margaret Atwood’s

               Right in the middle of all that, I heard David Baltimore give a talk on new developments in biotechnology. The combination of events gave me the idea of a talk on “Making New Life” for an upcoming SLSA meeting, and I expanded that into one of my chapters.

               On another occasion, I read a chemistry paper that proposed a particular mode of representing (on paper) a molecular structure—one that I vehemently disliked—and in formulating a response I saw an analogy to a comment—another one that I disliked—I had heard at a panel on literary translation, specifically of Dante’s

              <p>
               Not so much in the course of writing the book: as I said, I’d been working up to it over a 30 year period, during which the ubiquity of connections gradually grew more evident. At one point, I was (pleasantly) surprised to find plausible connections to my own chemistry research: some (erroneous) interpretations in an early paper seemed to me clearly linked to issues of recognizing simplicity and/or coded messages that are frequently addressed in literature—even to the arguable point that literary familiarity can be beneficial to effective scientific reasoning (I’m far from the only person who has made such an observation).

               Developing strong faculty relationships built on trust is a cornerstone of eCampus.com. Caltech will benefit from a dedicated eCampus.com account management team that will support faculty throughout the online bookstore transition with clear communication, proper training, and consistent dialogue. A key to academic success is having the right course materials at the right time. To facilitate this, faculty will have access to a streamlined online adoption platform known as FAST. The intuitive software allows for simplified research and selection of course materials all in one place. Within this system, faculty will be able to make adoption changes, order desk copies, see past adoptions, and ensure books will be ready and available for students prior to the first day of class. Custom materials, such as lab manuals and kits, will also be available. Faculty can research titles and compare pricing to make informed course material decisions. Robust analytics dashboards provide leadership with a high level of visibility to quickly evaluate key data such as adoption rates at both an institutional and departmental level. In addition, eCampus.com will also:

               A dedicated eCampus.com account management team will be available to faculty to address any questions that arise during the transition and adoption periods. In addition, the account team will be providing personalized virtual training in the days leading up to the transition to the new online bookstore. By submitting adoptions on time, faculty can ensure the proper availability of course materials so students can be prepared.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               Faculty can anticipate email communications within the next few weeks regarding access to the FAST adoption tool and specific training on how to submit adoptions, and verify the status of any adoptions imported from the previous provider. Having faculty’s full support is one of the best forms of promoting this new partnership and helping students understand the importance of ordering their professor-selected course materials from eCampus.com is vital to the success of this new solution. To help guide conversations, faculty will be alerted via email when the online bookstore is live for ordering, with specific talking points on how students can place orders. Additional communication that articulates the benefits of shopping from the online bookstore will also be provided.

               Members of the Caltech community are familiar with using the “CaltechConnect” button to connect to Library-provided electronic resources. Over time, other “Caltech Connect” services have been provided on campus. To distinguish this Library service from the others, we are excited to announce “Get It @ Caltech”!

               If you are on campus, this updated button takes you to full-text electronic books and journals if the Library subscribes, or directs you to DocuServe if we don’t. If you are off campus, you’ll be asked to provide your access.caltech credentials first before being routed to content or to DocuServe.
