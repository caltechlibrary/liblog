                Benefits for Faculty
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Developing strong faculty relationships built on trust is a cornerstone of eCampus.com. Caltech will benefit from a dedicated eCampus.com account management team that will support faculty throughout the online bookstore transition with clear communication, proper training, and consistent dialogue. A key to academic success is having the right course materials at the right time. To facilitate this, faculty will have access to a streamlined online adoption platform known as FAST. The intuitive software allows for simplified research and selection of course materials all in one place. Within this system, faculty will be able to make adoption changes, order desk copies, see past adoptions, and ensure books will be ready and available for students prior to the first day of class. Custom materials, such as lab manuals and kits, will also be available. Faculty can research titles and compare pricing to make informed course material decisions. Robust analytics dashboards provide leadership with a high level of visibility to quickly evaluate key data such as adoption rates at both an institutional and departmental level. In addition, eCampus.com will also:

              <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
               A dedicated eCampus.com account management team will be available to faculty to address any questions that arise during the transition and adoption periods. In addition, the account team will be providing personalized virtual training in the days leading up to the transition to the new online bookstore. By submitting adoptions on time, faculty can ensure the proper availability of course materials so students can be prepared.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               Faculty can anticipate email communications within the next few weeks regarding access to the FAST adoption tool and specific training on how to submit adoptions, and verify the status of any adoptions imported from the previous provider. Having faculty’s full support is one of the best forms of promoting this new partnership and helping students understand the importance of ordering their professor-selected course materials from eCampus.com is vital to the success of this new solution. To help guide conversations, faculty will be alerted via email when the online bookstore is live for ordering, with specific talking points on how students can place orders. Additional communication that articulates the benefits of shopping from the online bookstore will also be provided.

Students will also receive free standard shipping to home on all orders over $59 ordered from the online bookstore. Also of benefit is a 30-day return policy after the start of classes, giving students the confidence to order course materials early without penalty.

They even support a marketplace option that can offer course materials at savings up to 90%. Finally, eCampus.com addresses the importance of ease of ordering with an integrated shopping experience.

               The Caltech Library has undergone a year-long makeover and we’re ready for our close-up with the new website redesign that launches this week.
              </p>
              <p>
               Over the past academic year, the Library has implemented significant changes to the services we offer our patrons. In the fall 2021 term, the Library debuted LibSearch, a new catalog that brought together most of the library’s collections into a single interface, including books, ebooks, journal articles, Archives, repositories like CaltechAUTHORS, and more. Once that project was up and running, it was time to make the rest of the Library website equally efficient and responsive—not to mention attractive.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since the beginning of 2022, our website redesign team—project manager Melissa Johnson (who also helped manage the LibSearch implementation), programming lead Tommy Keswick, and design lead Chris Daley—have been building the new website from the ground up. Now we’re pleased to share the streamlined and stylish results. We invite patrons to explore the new website’s best features:

               Improved navigation
              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The team restructured the organization of our previous website with a focus on action-based menu categories, informed by user testing with Caltech students and faculty. We now have five main color-coded categories that make our services and resources easier to find and discover. The team also added landing pages at each subsection that orient patrons with brief descriptions of what they will find there.

              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The integration of the Caltech Archives &amp; Special Collections into the Library platform, when they previously had a stand-alone website, was an exciting and overdue development. The Caltech Archives is now part of the Library web ecosystem and its new home features improved architecture and aesthetics.

              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The team approached the redesign of our previous website with an eye to making it both easy and enjoyable to use. Images, colors, typeface, and graphics were chosen or modified to make the website more visually pleasing. An improved mobile design also enhances the user experience.

              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The Library seeks to promote equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging for all members of the Caltech community in all of our collections and services. With these goals in mind, the website redesign team considered improved accessibility at every step of the process. The team also redesigned the home page to allow the Library to share more news, events, and featured resources.

              <p dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               An extensive “spring cleaning” content audit of over 500 pages reduced redundancy and complexity, integrated Library research guides with webpages, and fortified our search results to fully include databases, FAQs, site info, and research guides.

              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               Choosing the LibGuides content management system improved efficiency for our Library staff due to integration with other Springshare products we already used. We also simplified content editing due to reduction from three disparate web content systems to the one we now present to our patrons.
