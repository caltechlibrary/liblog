                  This book presents a case for engagement between the sciences and the humanities. The author, a professional chemist, seeks to demonstrate that the connections between those fields of intellectual activity are far more significant than anything that separates them. The book combines a historical survey of the relationships between science and literature with a number of case studies that examine specific scientific episodes—several drawn from the author’s own research—juxtaposed with a variety of literary works spanning a wide range of period and genre—Dante to detective fiction,

                   War and Peace
                  </i>
                  to
                  <i>
                   White Teeth
                  </i>
                  —to elicit their common themes. The work argues for an empirical, non-theory-based approach, one that is closely analogous to connectionist models of brain development and function, and that can appeal to general readers, as well as to literary scholars and practicing scientists, who are open to the idea that literature and science should not be compartmentalized.

                  I’ve been interested in literature at least as long as in chemistry, but for a long time (until about 30 years ago) I read mostly recreationally.  I think two main influences (books I read) moved me to be more serious about literary scholarship and to explore connections between nominally different realms: Douglas Hofstadter’s

                  </em>
                  , and then discovered the existence of a whole community with like interests, the Society for Literature and Science (it’s since changed its name to the Society for Literature, Science and the Arts). I started going to meetings, reading a lot of works in the field that I heard about, and contributing some talks and essays of my own, which has come to occupy a large fraction (almost all of it, more recently) of my non-administrative time.

                  I’ve produced a number of studies, some published in various places but most just presented at SLSA meetings, not published at all; for the last few years, I was thinking about how they might fit together, hopefully coherently, in a collection. At the same time, my activity in chemistry research was starting to dial down, largely because my main collaborator (John Bercaw) had decided to retire, so it seemed like the right time. Looking back over that earlier work, the theme of finding connections stood out as a sort of guiding principle to how I selected topics, and I decided to try to write a book that would do several things: explain my rationale, survey some of the background and history of work along the boundaries between science and humanities, and present some of those studies (I ended up with seven) both as interesting stories on their own and as exemplars of my approach to the topic. I hoped that would lend some quality of uniqueness, as very few (alas) of those who work in these areas are professional scientists.

                  There has been a large component of serendipity in the selection of topics and works for the individual studies: often a literary work that I happened to read had some interesting science-related content and/or called to mind some particular scientific paper (sometimes one of my own)—or the reverse, a scientific paper reminded me of a literary work; sometimes a group of books that I read in a short period of time (again, largely due to coincidence—no planning usually involved!) seemed to resonate both with each other and with a scientific theme. Thus, for example, during the first few years of the 2000s, I read several books that featured creation of new forms of life (Margaret Atwood’s

                  On another occasion, I read a chemistry paper that proposed a particular mode of representing (on paper) a molecular structure—one that I vehemently disliked—and in formulating a response I saw an analogy to a comment—another one that I disliked—I had heard at a panel on literary translation, specifically of Dante’s

                  . Both of those essentially proclaimed that there was only one “right” way to do the representation/translation, so by connecting them I was able to argue against both.  (This is the only study that I have presented and published in both scientific and literary venues, of course suitably adapted to the respective audiences.)

                  Not so much in the course of writing the book: as I said, I’d been working up to it over a 30 year period, during which the ubiquity of connections gradually grew more evident. At one point, I was (pleasantly) surprised to find plausible connections to my own chemistry research: some (erroneous) interpretations in an early paper seemed to me clearly linked to issues of recognizing simplicity and/or coded messages that are frequently addressed in literature—even to the arguable point that literary familiarity can be beneficial to effective scientific reasoning (I’m far from the only person who has made such an observation).

              </p>
              <p>
               Developing strong faculty relationships built on trust is a cornerstone of eCampus.com. Caltech will benefit from a dedicated eCampus.com account management team that will support faculty throughout the online bookstore transition with clear communication, proper training, and consistent dialogue. A key to academic success is having the right course materials at the right time. To facilitate this, faculty will have access to a streamlined online adoption platform known as FAST. The intuitive software allows for simplified research and selection of course materials all in one place. Within this system, faculty will be able to make adoption changes, order desk copies, see past adoptions, and ensure books will be ready and available for students prior to the first day of class. Custom materials, such as lab manuals and kits, will also be available. Faculty can research titles and compare pricing to make informed course material decisions. Robust analytics dashboards provide leadership with a high level of visibility to quickly evaluate key data such as adoption rates at both an institutional and departmental level. In addition, eCampus.com will also:

               A dedicated eCampus.com account management team will be available to faculty to address any questions that arise during the transition and adoption periods. In addition, the account team will be providing personalized virtual training in the days leading up to the transition to the new online bookstore. By submitting adoptions on time, faculty can ensure the proper availability of course materials so students can be prepared.
              </p>
              <p dir="ltr">
               Faculty can anticipate email communications within the next few weeks regarding access to the FAST adoption tool and specific training on how to submit adoptions, and verify the status of any adoptions imported from the previous provider. Having faculty’s full support is one of the best forms of promoting this new partnership and helping students understand the importance of ordering their professor-selected course materials from eCampus.com is vital to the success of this new solution. To help guide conversations, faculty will be alerted via email when the online bookstore is live for ordering, with specific talking points on how students can place orders. Additional communication that articulates the benefits of shopping from the online bookstore will also be provided.

               The Caltech Library has undergone a year-long makeover and we’re ready for our close-up with the new website redesign that launches this week.
              </p>
              <p>
               Over the past academic year, the Library has implemented significant changes to the services we offer our patrons. In the fall 2021 term, the Library debuted LibSearch, a new catalog that brought together most of the library’s collections into a single interface, including books, ebooks, journal articles, Archives, repositories like CaltechAUTHORS, and more. Once that project was up and running, it was time to make the rest of the Library website equally efficient and responsive—not to mention attractive.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since the beginning of 2022, our website redesign team—project manager Melissa Johnson (who also helped manage the LibSearch implementation), programming lead Tommy Keswick, and design lead Chris Daley—have been building the new website from the ground up. Now we’re pleased to share the streamlined and stylish results. We invite patrons to explore the new website’s best features:

              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The team restructured the organization of our previous website with a focus on action-based menu categories, informed by user testing with Caltech students and faculty. We now have five main color-coded categories that make our services and resources easier to find and discover. The team also added landing pages at each subsection that orient patrons with brief descriptions of what they will find there.

               Archives integration
              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The integration of the Caltech Archives &amp; Special Collections into the Library platform, when they previously had a stand-alone website, was an exciting and overdue development. The Caltech Archives is now part of the Library web ecosystem and its new home features improved architecture and aesthetics.

              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The team approached the redesign of our previous website with an eye to making it both easy and enjoyable to use. Images, colors, typeface, and graphics were chosen or modified to make the website more visually pleasing. An improved mobile design also enhances the user experience.

              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               The Library seeks to promote equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging for all members of the Caltech community in all of our collections and services. With these goals in mind, the website redesign team considered improved accessibility at every step of the process. The team also redesigned the home page to allow the Library to share more news, events, and featured resources.

              <p dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               An extensive “spring cleaning” content audit of over 500 pages reduced redundancy and complexity, integrated Library research guides with webpages, and fortified our search results to fully include databases, FAQs, site info, and research guides.

               Benefits to Library staff
              </h4>
              <p dir="ltr" role="presentation" style="margin-left: 40px;">
               Choosing the LibGuides content management system improved efficiency for our Library staff due to integration with other Springshare products we already used. We also simplified content editing due to reduction from three disparate web content systems to the one we now present to our patrons.
