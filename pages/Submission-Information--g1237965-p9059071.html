            <strong>
             The final corrected version of a thesis must be uploaded to CaltechTHESIS by the fifth week (~2 months) of the succeeding term if the candidate defended his or her thesis during the previous summer or the first and second terms; or two weeks before the degree is to be conferred if the candidate defended during the month of May.

            <strong>
             If you are in a hurry to get your Letter of Completion from the Registrar, it is your responsibility to notify the Grad Office.  The best time to do so is right after you have deposited your thesis.

             <li>
              DO NOT CREATE a new version of the original record in CaltechTHESIS. We will have to transfer all your changes from the new to the original record, and delete the new version. This slows everything down for everyone.
             </li>

              Simply make the required changes on the original record and resubmit that one.

            If you are interested in restricting access to your thesis, ask yourself if you only need to embargo certain portions of your thesis. You may not need to embargo the whole thesis.
            <ul>
             <li>
              If a partial embargo will do, upload both your full thesis file AND a redacted thesis file.
             </li>
             <li>
              The redacted thesis file can have the relevant material omitted.  On the page in the thesis where the omitted content would normally be, and add a statement to the reader saying something like "[This chapter is temporarily embargoed.]" or "[Intentionally redacted.]"
