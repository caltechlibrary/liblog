           The Inclusion and Social Justice Team is working to improve the Caltech Library's collections with regard to inclusion and equity, with work being done in major areas:
          </p>
          <h3>
           Controlled vocabularies
          </h3>
          <p>
           Caltech Library systems (like LibSearch) use controlled vocabularies to help you find information. Controlled vocabularies are lists of standard terms used to describe information in a library catalog. An example of a controlled vocabulary we use is Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). Too often controlled vocabularies contain terms that harm and oppress minoritized groups and are slow to change. As part of the Caltech Library’s commitment to inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility, we want to identify and update those terms in our systems.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Promoting equitable collections and collection development
          </h3>
          <p>
           Collections are at the heart of the work done by the Caltech Library. Contrary to library mythology, library collections are not neutral. Without conscious and concerted effort, library collections can easily amplify dominant voices and harm minoritized populations. To counteract this, the Caltech Library must: develop inclusive collections policies; purchase and promote materials that are outside of the western, white narratives that dominate science; and remove offensive materials from our existing collections.

           The Caltech Library Programming and Events Committee chooses and displays library resources in Sherman Fairchild Library. These resources cover inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility topics overlooked in academic libraries at STEM institutions and are available to students, faculty, and staff to check out.

           The goal of the Programming and Events Committee is to raise awareness of the library’s offerings, increase library usage, and create a larger footprint in the lives of Caltech students. The Programming and Events Committee aims to complement and enrich campus and community life through collaborations and partnerships to create cultural and civic programming. The Committee supports the library's diversity, equity, and inclusion strategic priority and has hosted events as a part of that support: Stress Free Week (during midterms and finals), Summer Movie Nights, Lunar New Year Celebrations, APIDA+ Art Therapy, and Blind Date with a Book.

           The Caltech Library promotes equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging in all of our collections and services. We are committed to providing an inclusive environment for all members of our community, and seek to accommodate people with all physical, sensory, and mental disabilities. The Caltech Library Accessibility Committee is a standing committee of Caltech Library staff, and it is charged to address all areas of accessibility to the Library’s services and physical and digital spaces.

           As a part of this effort, the Committee coordinated accessibility assessments of all library services and spaces. We developed full and detailed descriptions of our library locations including information about physical spaces, restrooms, quiet spaces, and lighting. You can find this information on
