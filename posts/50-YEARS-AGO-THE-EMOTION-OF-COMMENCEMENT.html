     The pomp and cheerful animation of commencement ceremonies mark an important milestone for students and their families, who savor the culmination of years of hard work, and the beginning of a new phase of life. To celebrate this year's Commencement, the Caltech Archives are pleased to present a photographic gallery of the 1965 Commencement exercises, performed during the tenure of President Lee A. DuBridge. The speaker that year was Frank Stanton, president of CBS at the time.
     <br/>
     Although many things have changed in the last 50 years, we believe that the class of 2015 will recognize themselves in the youthful enthusiasm of their 1965 predecessors and we congratulate this and all generations of outstanding Caltech graduates.
