     The first floor of Caltech Hall will soon be a productive and creative hub for the Caltech community. Renovations are underway to transform the space into a new home for the Library's Techlab for 3D printing, its technology lending program, an additional Caltech Archives exhibition space, and a cozy reading nook. Pro tip: While you're there, don't miss out on riding the elevator to the ninth floor reading room to take in the stunning view of the San Gabriel Mountains.

     The east side of the first floor will be the future home of the Library’s Techlab. The new space will allow the Techlab to add a waiting area with soft seating, two additional 3D printers, and two dedicated post-processing tables where patrons can put the final touches on their completed prints.

     The lobby will now be home to an additional Archives exhibition space, which will include physical pieces as well as a digital display. The first exhibit will be an extension of Becoming Caltech, which is the Archives’ current exhibit about how Throop University became the California Institute of Technology.

     The west side of the first floor will be home to the technology lending program and feature a reading nook where you can purchase books or order them from the Library.

     The space will be ready to welcome visitors when the campus can safely reopen.
