     The Caltech Library is pleased to announce that Bianca Rios has assumed the role of Access &amp; E-Resources Services Librarian as of this month. Bianca began working for library eleven years ago and her experience and expertise as a Library Support Associate made her the strongest candidate for the Access &amp; E-Resources Services Librarian position. Like many people who find their way into library work, Bianca was drawn to it from a public service perspective. “I like helping people find information and get the assistance they need. Since I’ve been working for the Caltech Library since 2009, I feel very invested in the Caltech community and my coworkers as well.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Bianca will be managing the full life cycle of electronic resources, from assisting with acquisitions, providing and handling problems related to access, and assessing usage in order to decide whether or not we should continue subscribing to content. She will also manage our course reserves system and work closely with staff in Access and Collection Services and Research Services to provide a system for students and instructors to easily get to materials for their classes.
    </p>
    <p>
     What ties all of Bianca’s responsibilities together is a focus on engagement, outreach, and user experience. She thinks there is potential to bring in more users to the library in surprising and unconventional ways and says, “I’d like to explore and improve the user experience, not just of our patrons but of library staff, too. I get to work with colleagues from across all library departments in this role and see it as an ‘inreach’
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     outreach position.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When asked what she would like people to know about the Library's access and e-resources services, Bianca emphasized that the Library's service points and staff have always been about getting resources to the Caltech community as quickly and seamlessly as possible. She wants patrons to know that we take their needs seriously and will continue to do so. “It’s especially important as we’ve shifted more towards remote learning and online access to library resources.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The mix of responsibilities involved in the Access &amp; E-Resources Services Librarian role spoke to Bianca’s experience, interests, and hobbies. She tells us, “Any role where I can be involved in learning about and understanding my coworkers’ systems and workflows and improving processes and services, I will happily jump into, whether it’s about course reserves, e-resource management, or access services in general. Plus, I still get to work with my ACS colleagues, just in a different capacity, so I’m very happy about it!”
    </p>
    <p>
     This new position will give Bianca the opportunity to think more creatively about our services and conduct research on what other institutions’ libraries are doing to provide better services for their users.
    </p>
    <p>
     When not working for the Library, you might find Bianca rock climbing, studying social history and culture, or playing guitar, something she’s been doing for twenty years with a dream of perhaps one day becoming a classical guitar teacher. Until then, we’re delighted to welcome Bianca as our new Access &amp; E-Resources Services Librarian!
