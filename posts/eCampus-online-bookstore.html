     with fall textbooks available in the coming weeks. The transition to an online bookstore presents several exciting benefits for students, faculty, and staff.

     <strong>
      Benefits for Faculty
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Developing strong faculty relationships built on trust is a cornerstone of eCampus.com. Caltech will benefit from a dedicated eCampus.com account management team that will support faculty throughout the online bookstore transition with clear communication, proper training, and consistent dialogue. A key to academic success is having the right course materials at the right time. To facilitate this, faculty will have access to a streamlined online adoption platform known as FAST. The intuitive software allows for simplified research and selection of course materials all in one place. Within this system, faculty will be able to make adoption changes, order desk copies, see past adoptions, and ensure books will be ready and available for students prior to the first day of class. Custom materials, such as lab manuals and kits, will also be available. Faculty can research titles and compare pricing to make informed course material decisions. Robust analytics dashboards provide leadership with a high level of visibility to quickly evaluate key data such as adoption rates at both an institutional and departmental level. In addition, eCampus.com will also:

       Ensure the materials selected are accurately listed on the Caltech Online Bookstore
      </p>
     </li>
     <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
       Alert faculty/administration to any changes in the status of selected books (i.e. out of print, out of stock, substituted for a new edition, etc.)
      </p>
     </li>
     <li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
       Work with the faculty and the publishers to ensure timely and accurate delivery of the correct materials
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">
     A dedicated eCampus.com account management team will be available to faculty to address any questions that arise during the transition and adoption periods. In addition, the account team will be providing personalized virtual training in the days leading up to the transition to the new online bookstore. By submitting adoptions on time, faculty can ensure the proper availability of course materials so students can be prepared.
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
     Faculty can anticipate email communications within the next few weeks regarding access to the FAST adoption tool and specific training on how to submit adoptions, and verify the status of any adoptions imported from the previous provider. Having faculty’s full support is one of the best forms of promoting this new partnership and helping students understand the importance of ordering their professor-selected course materials from eCampus.com is vital to the success of this new solution. To help guide conversations, faculty will be alerted via email when the online bookstore is live for ordering, with specific talking points on how students can place orders. Additional communication that articulates the benefits of shopping from the online bookstore will also be provided.

      Benefits for Students
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
     With the new Caltech Online Bookstore, students will have 24/7 access to a customized website that guarantees the right books at the right time, and the right price. Course materials will be linked to each student’s class schedule for easy identification of the correct materials and seamless ordering. With a price match guarantee, students can shop with confidence knowing that they will receive the very best price.
    </p>
    <p>
     Additional benefits include access to free expedited shipping of course materials to Sherman Fairchild Library. Students will also receive free standard shipping to home on all orders over $59 ordered from the online bookstore. Also of benefit is a 30-day return policy after the start of classes, giving students the confidence to order course materials early without penalty. Furthermore, eCampus.com addresses affordability by offering every purchasing option, including new, used, rental and eBook. They even support a marketplace option that can offer course materials at savings up to 90%. Finally, eCampus.com addresses the importance of ease of ordering with an integrated shopping experience. Students will have instant access to required course materials at the time of registration with single sign-on to streamline ordering and payment.
