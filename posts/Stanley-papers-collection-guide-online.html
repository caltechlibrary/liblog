     The Gordon J. Stanley papers were donated to the Caltech Archives in February 2012 by the Stanley Family Trust. This small, yet unique, collection covers Stanley's research involvement in radio astronomy, both in Australia and the United States.

     Stanley was born in Cambridge, New Zealand on July 1, 1921. He became an engineer by training and was among a group of scientists who in 1944 joined the Radiophysics Laboratory of the
     <em>
      Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
     </em>
     (CSIRO) in Sydney, Australia. He later worked at the Dover Heights field station and was a key contributor along with John Bolton, Bruce Slee, Dick McGee, Joe Pawsey and others to early radio astronomy.

     In mid-1955, Stanley left Australia and followed his close colleague, John Bolton, to Caltech. They began searching for a suitable site for Caltech's new radio observatory. Stanley found the ideal location in Owens Valley, and along with Bolton and Bruce Rule, Caltech's Chief Engineer, designed the first radio interferometer operating above a few hundred megahertz.

     This interferometer became fully operational in 1960 and shortly thereafter Bolton returned to Australia. Stanley was subsequently appointed Director of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, a position he held until his retirement in 1975.
