     After much research and deliberation, the Caltech Library is excited to announce we will adopt the FOLIO Library Services Platform (LSP) for use starting in the fall 2021 term. The open-source FOLIO platform will be hosted by EBSCO Information Services, the leading provider of discovery services, databases, and other information resources and services for libraries worldwide. EBSCO contributes substantially to the technical development of FOLIO software and offers FOLIO hosting and data management services.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Library’s LSP Evaluation Team strongly supported FOLIO, which stands for the Future of Libraries Is Open, as our new platform. “FOLIO is the product of an open-source community that includes both vendors and libraries. Open-source software development is a natural fit for the Caltech spirit of innovation and open, reproducible science.” A contributing factor to the Library’s decision was the fact that “the FOLIO project is powered by libraries whose adoption of the system means they are extremely invested in solving problems with its day-to-day operations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Users will have unified access to the Library's print and digital collections (e-books, e-journals, databases) through the newly refined EBSCO Discovery Service. The Library will be engaging with the Caltech community during the configuration and testing of this new service.
    </p>
    <p>
     University Librarian Kara Whatley was instrumental in the decision to move to a new LSP. She explains, “I think being new to the Caltech Library allowed me to ask questions and consider the answers with a fresh perspective. So, soon after I joined Caltech as University Librarian, I realized that we had some challenges with our current information access systems. I asked a team of staff from across the Library to create a list of ‘blue sky’ requirements for an integrated library system (ILS) or a library services platform (LSP) to meet the needs of our users and our staff. Armed with that list of requirements, the team then began a careful review of offerings in this arena. It soon became clear to the team and to me that FOLIO via EBSCO would be the best fit for users, our staff workflows, and our Library culture.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A Library Services Platform is much more than a traditional library catalog. FOLIO will allow the Library to integrate management of and access to both physical and electronic collections for the first time. There is also potential for more integrated access to other library collections of research outputs (such as CaltechAUTHORS and CaltechDATA) as well as Caltech Archives and Special Collections. Stephen Davison, Head of Digital Library Development, points out, “Two aspects of FOLIO are particularly attractive. It's an open source project, and the software is highly modular. This gives us a wide range of integration possibilities in the future, with other products and platform providers, and with software we develop ourselves.”
    </p>

     The Library already has a solid relationship with EBSCO and thinks highly of the support they’ve offered through the years we’ve worked with them. Several of EBSCO’s support staff are now involved with FOLIO’s development and implementation so, as Kara Whatley explains, we’re in good hands. “We’ve worked with EBSCO for a number of years, relying on tools such as Full Text Finder and EDS to power our discovery services, and I could not be more excited about deepening our partnership with them by adopting FOLIO.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The LSP Evaluation Team was unanimous in choosing FOLIO as a good fit for the Library, noting advantages such as its e-resource management and its ability to integrate with external applications. The Team’s comprehensive report states, “We believe that adoption of FOLIO will provide us with the potential to achieve efficient integration of our various Library services, as well as providing us with the ability to be creative to the degree that is appropriate for our size and standing. The hosting and other services provided by EBSCO bring us all the benefits of a closed vendor-built system, without being locked in.”
