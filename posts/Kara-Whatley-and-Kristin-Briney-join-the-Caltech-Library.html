     The Caltech Library is pleased to announce two new additions to our team: Kara Whatley, University Librarian, and Kristin Briney, Biology &amp; Biological Engineering Librarian.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Kara Whatley (right)
     </strong>
     was the Head of Science &amp; Engineering for the NYU Division of Libraries before coming to Caltech. Prior to that, she was the Life Sciences Librarian and Head of the Coles Science Center at NYU’s Bobst Library, and Interim Library Director at NYU Shanghai.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kara holds a master’s degree in biological sciences from Texas Tech University, a master’s degree in library and information studies from the University of Oklahoma, and a bachelor’s degree in biology from Hendrix College. She is an active member of the American Library Association, where she held offices in the New Member Roundtable and the Association of College and Research Libraries’ Science and Technology Section. Her professional and research interests include mentoring opportunities for new library professionals, user behavior in virtual reference environments, and effective communication in libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kara says that she “feels strongly that libraries should reflect the communities that they serve, and they must continuously engage their communities to ensure they are meeting the community’s needs and expectations. Academic libraries seek to support the research and teaching of the institution they serve, and that supporting role requires building strong relationships across campus at every level.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I look forward to working with Caltech faculty, students, and staff to build a library befitting the Institute, one that supports world-class research and pushes boundaries to address pressing needs in knowledge creation, dissemination, and preservation."
    </p>
    <p>

     joins Caltech from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where she worked as a Data Services Librarian. She holds a Ph.D in physical chemistry and a master’s degree in library and information studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and computer science from DePauw University. She is also author of the book, Data Management for Researchers. Her professional interests include data management, open science, privacy, and converting the world to ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).
    </p>
    <p>
     "So much interesting research is being done at Caltech,” Kristin says, “and I'm excited to join the Library to support researchers' information finding and publishing needs."
