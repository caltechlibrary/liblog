     Seymour Benzer (1921-2007), the father of neurogenetics, was one of the leading biologists of his time. His papers, presented to Caltech by his family in 2008, are now being arranged for future access by researchers. Benzer's scientific interests covered three distinct fields: physics (semiconductors), molecular biology (bacteriophage genetics) and neurobiology (the relationship between genes and behavior, working with mutants of the fruit fly Drosophila). These three fields are highlighted in the wealth of material: research notebooks, correspondence and reprints. The notebooks demonstrate his meticulous work over close to 70 years of scientific creativity and innovation. The correspondence reflects his cooperation and lifelong relationships with some of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, including numerous Nobel Prize winners. His correspondents include Francis Crick, James Watson, Francois Jacob, Salvador Luria, Max Delbruck, Eric Kandel, Sydney Brenner and Renato Dulbecco. The material also reveals his role as mentor and advisor to generations of students.
