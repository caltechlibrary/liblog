     Richard L. and Dorothy M. Hayman Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Professor of Jet Propulsion Emeritus, Frank Marble, was a member of the Caltech community for over 50 years. Before coming to Caltech in 1946, Marble earned both his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and M.S. in Applied Mathematics in 1940 and 1942, from the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio (now known as Case Western Reserve University).

     During WWII he worked with NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), where he managed projects to address engine cooling issues for the Martin Marauder B-26 bomber and the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. After being awarded a pre-doctoral fellowship from the National Research Council, Marble and his wife Ora Lee moved to Pasadena, and Marble completed his PhD in Aeronautics and Mathematics at Caltech. As a GALCIT faculty member, Marble's research made pioneering contributions to combustion in jet propulsion systems, propagation of acoustics waves, and flame stabilization. Besides being a pioneer in the field of aeronautics, he was a beloved teacher and advisor for over 40 years. In his oral history with Shirley Cohen, he stated how important his students were to him and that he and his wife always treated his students as an extended part of their family. In 2012, Marble&amp;rsquo;s former PhD and graduate students honored the Marbles by creating the Frank and Ora Lee Marble Endowed Professorship, which benefits a faculty member in the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences and ensures Marble&amp;rsquo;s continued legacy at Caltech.
