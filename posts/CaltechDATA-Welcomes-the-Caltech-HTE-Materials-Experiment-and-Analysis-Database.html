    <p>
     CaltechDATA is pleased to welcome over 17,000 records from the Caltech High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) group. The Materials Experiment and Analysis Database (MEAD) was collected by the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis over many years. It contains raw data and metadata from millions of materials synthesis and characterization experiments, as well as the analysis and distillation of that data into property and performance metrics. The unprecedented quantity and diversity of experimental data are searchable by experiment and analysis attributes generated by both researchers and data processing software. Each record is uniquely identified with a DataCite DOI, which allows links to the datasets to remain the same even after the transition. Data storage is supported by a grant from XSEDE on the Open Storage Network. The migration of this database illustrates how data resources created at Caltech can be sustainably managed for the long term by Caltech Library in the CaltechDATA repository.
